# craps-GUI

This repository contains the necessary files to run an application I created to play an interactive craps game in a GUI.

Among these files are die.py, craps.py, and crapsGUI.py which contain the classes that create the GUI and run the craps game in it. These are entirely my work, though the inspiration for them stems from Projects 6 and 7 in Chapter 9 of Kenneth Lambert's Fundamentals of Python: First Programs, 2nd ed., which themselves reference examples from the text.

Further, I have also include breezypythongui.py which is courtesy of Kenneth Lambert. This file is necessary to build the GUI in crapsGUI.py. You may find the source for this file here: https://kennethalambert.com/breezypythongui/.

Lastly, the DICE folder contains the images of six die faces, courtesy of Wikimedia Commons. You can find the sources for those images, for example, here: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alea_1.png. (Replace 1 with 2,...,6 to see other sources.)
